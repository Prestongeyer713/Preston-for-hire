# Preston-for-hire

This is my personal website. here you'll find links to my current and past projects. Here I utilized css flex and various html elements to get the exact format I wanted. Using variable assets in css I was able to make changes to my code much easier and faster. And with the inclusion of my secondary style sheet "hamburgers.css" I was able to add some transparent effects to my header and projects folder to provide a more pleasent veiwing experience. As I learn more about web development this website along with my projects will grow to be more complicated and well developed.
